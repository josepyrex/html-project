<h2>Now for the cooking part:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove and discard the stems from the mushrooms. Clean the mushroom tops and slice them thinly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the butter and olive oil to a non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook the mushrooms until browned and the liquid is mostly evaporated. Season them with salt and a little of the Herbs de Provence. Use a slotted spoon to remove the mushrooms to a clean bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the Wagyu Beef into four portions. Gently shape them into burgers. Season the burgers evenly with the remaining Herbs de Provence seasoning, salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the burgers to the same skillet that the mushrooms were cooked in, don't wipe out the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the burgers over medium heat on the first side for about four minutes. Flip the burgers over and cook for an additional 3 - 6 minutes, depending on how you like your burger cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
            Medium rare burgers will take about 6 - 7 minutes, Medium burgers will cook in about 8 minutes and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of the brioche buns. Top the lettuce with a burger. Spread a generous amount of Boursin cheese on top of the Wagyu burger. Top it with some cooked mushrooms and then the top half of the bun. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
