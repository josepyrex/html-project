    <h1>Pyrex's Frites a la mode</h1>
    <img src="/assets/Frites.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Ingredients necessary:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 pounds baking potatoes, such as Idaho russets or Bintje, peeled and cut into thick fries, 3/4 inch by 3 inches
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (up to 3 tablespoons)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch fine sea salt, to taste
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now for the cooking part:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 500Â° F. Bring 1 quart of water to a simmer in the bottom of a steamer. Place the potatoes on the steaming rack, place the rack in the steamer, cover, and steam just until a knife inserted in a potato comes away clean, 10 to 12 minutes. (The potatoes should not be cooked through, or they will tend to fall apart.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the steamed potatoes to a bowl and drizzle with oil. Carefully toss to coat evenly with oil. (The potatoes can be prepared to this point several hours in advance. Set aside at room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            With a large slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes in a single layer to a nonstick baking sheet. Discard any excess oil or liquid. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake, turning so they brown evenly, until the potatoes are crisp and deep golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, season generously with salt, and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>And you're done! Enjoy :)</h2>
